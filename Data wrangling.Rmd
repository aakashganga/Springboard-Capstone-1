```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Data wrangling on this data set was rather straighforward and uninvolved. I checked for missing values using the Summary function, and found none. Column names were already short and intuitive. 

The only wrangling that was done involved creating a new column for rating category: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
amazon_categories <- amazon_original %>% mutate(rating_category = case_when(
  .$Score == 5 ~ "Positive",
  .$Score == 4 ~ "Positive",
  .$Score == 3 ~ "Neutral",
  .$Score == 2 ~ "Negative",
  .$Score == 1 ~ "Negative"))

  ```
